# File descriptions

## readForceCoefficientData3D2liquidMixing.py
This file reads the postProcessing data generated by openFoam, e.g. the force coefficients, and produces figures for the main results of the theses.  
To run this file on another computer, one must change the path names.  
The paths for the input files with the post processing data are specific for my computer.  

## readForceCoefficientDataMeshSensitivity.py
This file generates the plots for the mesh sensitvity tests.  
The paths of the input files must be changed for running this file on another computer.

## Contour
This file generates the wave elevation and velocity profile plots.  
Filenames must be changed for use of this file on another computer.
